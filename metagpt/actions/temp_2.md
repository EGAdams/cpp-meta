'## Original Requirements:\n\nCreate a C++ Google Unit Test for the following file:\n\n```cpp\n#include "Mode1Score.h"\n\nMode1Score::Mode1Score( IPlayer* player1, IPlayer* player2, IPinInterface* pinInterface, IGameState* gameState, IHistory* history ) :\n    _player1( player1 ),\n    _player2( player2 ),\n    _gameState( gameState ),\n    _history( history ),\n    _Mode1TieBreaker( player1, player2, pinInterface, gameState, history ),\n    _pointLeds( player1, player2, pinInterface ),\n    _gameLeds( player1, player2, pinInterface ),\n    _setLeds( player1, player2, pinInterface ),\n    _mode1WinSequences( player1, player2, pinInterface, gameState ),\n    _undo( player1, player2, pinInterface, gameState )\n{}\n\nMode1Score::~Mode1Score()\n{}\n\nvoid Mode1Score::updateScore( IPlayer* currentPlayer )\n{\n    IPlayer* otherPlayer = currentPlayer->getOpponent();\n\n    if ( currentPlayer->getPoints() >= 3 )\n    {\n        if ( currentPlayer->getPoints() == otherPlayer->getPoints() )\n        {\n            currentPlayer->setPoints( 3 );\n            otherPlayer->setPoints( 3 );\n        }\n        else if ( currentPlayer->getPoints() > 3 && ( currentPlayer->getPoints() - otherPlayer->getPoints() ) > 1 )\n        {\n            currentPlayer->setGames( currentPlayer->getGames() + 1 );\n            _undo.memory();\n            currentPlayer->number() == 1 ? mode1P1Games() : mode1P2Games();\n        }\n\n        if ( currentPlayer->getPoints() == 4 )\n        {\n            // std::cout << "inside updateScore().  points == 4.  setting point flash to 1..." << std::endl;\n            _gameState->setPointFlash( 1 );\n            _gameState->setPreviousTime( GameTimer::gameMillis() );\n            _gameState->setToggle( 0 );\n        }\n    }\n\n    // std::cout << "inside updateScore().  updating points..." << std::endl;\n    _pointLeds.updatePoints();\n}\n```\n\n## Product Goals:\n\n- Create a C++ Google Unit Test for the Mode1Score class\n- Ensure that the unit test covers all possible scenarios and edge cases\n- Validate the correctness and reliability of the Mode1Score class\n\n## User Stories:\n\n- As a developer, I want to be able to run a unit test for the Mode1Score class to ensure its functionality.\n- As a tester, I want to verify that the Mode1Score class handles different scenarios correctly.\n- As a team lead, I want to have confidence in the reliability of the Mode1Score class by running a comprehensive unit test.\n- As a developer, I want the unit test to cover all possible edge cases to ensure the robustness of the Mode1Score class.\n- As a team member, I want the unit test to be easy to understand and maintain for future updates.\n\n## Competitive Analysis:\n\n- Cpp Snake Game: A C++ game that allows players to control a snake and collect food while avoiding obstacles.\n- Cpp Tic Tac Toe: A C++ implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game.\n- Cpp Blackjack: A C++ implementation of the popular card game Blackjack.\n- Cpp Sudoku Solver: A C++ program that solves Sudoku puzzles.\n- Cpp File Compression: A C++ program that compresses files using various compression algorithms.\n- Cpp Image Processing: A C++ library for image processing and manipulation.\n- Cpp Chat Application: A C++ application for real-time chat between multiple users.\n\n## Competitive Quadrant Chart:\n\n```mermaid\nquadrantChart\n    title Reach and engagement of campaigns\n    x-axis Low Reach --> High Reach\n    y-axis Low Engagement --> High Engagement\n    quadrant-1 We should expand\n    quadrant-2 Need to promote\n    quadrant-3 Re-evaluate\n    quadrant-4 May be improved\n    "Cpp Snake Game": [0.3, 0.6]\n    "Cpp Tic Tac Toe": [0.45, 0.23]\n    "Cpp Blackjack": [0.57, 0.69]\n    "Cpp Sudoku Solver": [0.78, 0.34]\n    "Cpp File Compression": [0.40, 0.34]\n    "Cpp Image Processing": [0.35, 0.78]\n    "Cpp Chat Application": [0.6, 0.7]\n    "Mode1Score": [0.5, 0.6]\n```\n\n## Requirement Analysis:\n\nThe product should provide a comprehensive unit test for the Mode1Score class. The unit test should cover all possible scenarios and edge cases to ensure the correctness and reliability of the class. The unit test should be easy to understand and maintain for future updates.\n\n## Requirement Pool:\n\n- The unit test should verify that the Mode1Score class correctly updates the score based on the current player\'s points and the opponent\'s points. (P0)\n- The unit test should verify that the Mode1Score class correctly handles tie scenarios where both players have the same number of points. (P1)\n- The unit test should verify that the Mode1Score class correctly increments the games count for the current player when they have more than 3 points and the difference between their points and the opponent\'s points is greater than 1. (P1)\n- The unit test should verify that the Mode1Score class correctly sets the point flash and toggle values in the game state when the current player has 4 points. (P2)\n- The unit test should verify that the Mode1Score class correctly updates the point LEDs based on the current player\'s points. (P2)\n\n## UI Design draft:\n\nThe unit test does not require a user interface. It will be implemented as a separate C++ file that includes the necessary headers and test cases for the Mode1Score class. The test cases will be executed using a testing framework, such as Google Test.\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR:\n\nThere are no unclear points.'
